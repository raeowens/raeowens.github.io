  <p class="one">Postpartum Doula</p>

  <p>Hello There! My name is Rae Owens and I am currently on my way towards becoming a certified postpartum doula through Childbirth International!</p>

  <p>You may be wondering why you would even need a postpartum doula. Many people don't even know exactly what that means. Let me explain! Simply put, postpartum doulas are there to help a new family during those first few days, weeks or even months after bringing home a brand new baby (or more)! This would be especially beneficial for single parents, first time parents, or any moms and dads that won't have access to help from other friends or family members. Your postpartum doula is there to help take away the stress of everyday life so that you can put 100% of your focus on your new arrival(s)!</p>

  <p>In addition to providing help around your household, postpartum doulas are there to give evidence based information on all things baby related! This can include infant feeding, physical and emotional support after birth, infant and mother bonding, infant soothing, and basic newborn care instruction.</p>

  <p>I provide these basic services and many more!</p>
